"""The generic single-pool VPD training step over a `DecomposedModel` (SPEC §4).

One `jax.jit` step: clean target → CI envelope → per-persistent-term supplemental
ascents + per-fresh-entry sign-PGD ascents (`adversary.py`) → faith + imp-min +
the recon loss TERMS (`recon.py`; each term = plan × mask-source strategy, SPEC
S10') → one fused backward over (components, ci_fn, all persistent sources) →
optimizer updates → each persistent term's final ascent from the same graph,
unscaled by ITS coeff (SPEC S13'/S14'/S23). All trainable state is fp32 masters
(SPEC N1); forwards run in bf16 via explicit casts.

Schedules (imp-min p anneal, source-LR warmup) are computed inside the step from
`state.step`, so the jit signature is stable across the whole run (SPEC S9, S13).
Per-term RNG: term i draws from `fold_in(step_key, 1 + i)` in config-list order
(SPEC R1) — this reproduces the pre-unification production key derivation exactly.
