"""Pytest entry for the cross-framework PD equivalence harness.

Two kinds of check:

  * **Numeric (cross-framework).** `test_jax_matches_torch_reference` runs the JAX side of
    the harness on the committed fixtures and asserts every loss term matches the committed
    `torch_reference.json` (produced by `torch_reference.py` in the torch env) to fp32
    tolerance. This is the watertight numeric verification: identical fixtures into both
    frameworks, the torch values from the REAL reference functions
    (`faithfulness_loss` / `importance_minimality_terms` / `recon_loss_kl` /
    `get_ppgd_mask_infos` / `LinearComponents.forward`), compared at ~1e-4.

  * **Structural.** `test_structure_*` pin SPEC invariants that aren't a single number:
    the stochastic recon runs ONE forward PER CHUNK (S10), recon is KL not MSE (§2.3),
    and the PPGD source carries the trailing raw weight-delta channel (S1).
    `test_sc_source_broadcasts_over_batch_in_masked_forward` pins the sc-scope
    broadcast (S1/S16): an `(1, T, C+1)` source broadcasts over `[B, T]` in the masked
    forward, and a B/T-transposed source must break it (the fixtures keep `B != T`).

  * **Chunk-plan static-live gate (S2).** `test_chunk_plan_static_live_gate` drives
    `masked_output` with a live set that splits a layer's MLP (`live = (l0.gate, l0.up)`,
    `l0.down` frozen) — the realization the production `subset_chunk_plan` hits when a
    chunk boundary cuts across a layer, which `stoch` (whole-layer chunks) and `ppgd`
    (all sites live) never exercise — and asserts it equals an explicit reference that
    hard-codes the frozen site to `x @ W`.

`torch_reference.json` is a FROZEN committed golden. The torch generator that produced
it (`torch_reference.py`) is deleted — `param_decomp` imports no torch. To regen
(only if the math or fixtures change): check out the `torch-oracle` git tag in a
separate worktree, run that revision's `torch_reference.py` in the torch
(`param-decomp`) venv, and copy the resulting `torch_reference.json` back here. The
fixtures themselves (`fixtures.npz`) are still drawn JAX-side by `gen_fixtures.py`.
